# annotorious-desktop

A minimalistic desktop IIIF viewer ([Openseadragon](https://github.com/openseadragon/openseadragon)) with annotation functions ([Annotorious-openseadragon](https://github.com/recogito/annotorious-openseadragon)).  
Made with [webview](https://github.com/zserge/webview), annotations are persisted locally into an SQLite database (`~/.annotorious/annotorious.db`).

Still a proof of concept, incomplete and not fully tested.
